# Text-Summarization-using-BART-Model
In this project, we explore text summarization using the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model, a state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model developed by Facebook AI. We utilise the CNN-DailyMail dataset, which contains news articles paired with human-generated summaries.
